# gitlog.sty -- Typeset git logs as bibliographies

The *gitlog* package allows git change log history to be incorporated into LaTeX documents; the log data is obtained from the git distributed version control system.

The current release (0.0.beta) is a proof-of-concept release to allow users an early evaluation and to attract ideas and support.

Requests and suggestions, as well as code contributions are welcome, via email, or as issues or pull requests on either Github or Bitbucket. The repository URLs are:
